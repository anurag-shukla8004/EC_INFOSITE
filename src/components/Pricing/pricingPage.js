</h2>
          <p className='questonPara'>Some of the key advantages of hiring an app agency are:

</p>

<ul className='questonPara' style={{listStyle:'disc'}}>
  <li>Clear-cut milestones: Dedicated app agencies with good references & experience lay out well-defined milestones for the app development process and stick to them. You will know exactly how much time it takes and what to expect when.



</li>
  <li>Time to market: A dedicated agency is far more likely to complete your app ahead of the estimated time, as it has a wide variety of services and resources available at the click of a button to finish your job.



</li>
  <li>A variety of resources: App development agencies have a wide variety of resources or experts at their disposal. These include designers, programmers, developers, content creators & the like. This helps save a lot of time.



</li>
<li>Security: Experienced app development agencies give topmost importance to the security of their clients’ data. They maintain utmost care even while sharing information within their team. To safeguard yourself further, you can incorporate a data security clause that covers your project idea, source code & all of your data.

</li>
<li>Budget sensitivity: Since agencies have experience from working with a variety of clients from across the globe, they can clearly estimate the number of hours that will be required to develop a certain website or app and adjust the billing as per the client’s budget.
</li>
<li>Support & maintenance: Dedicated app development agencies can also offer you maintenance & support services once app development is complete, without you having to hire a person or team for the same.
</li>
<li>Concentrate on your core business: Outsourcing your app development work to an agency that specializes in the same gives you time & bandwidth to concentrate on your core business/area of expertise to make your product/service better. After all, your customers buy from you more because they’re happy with your product or service, and less because of how impressive your app is.
